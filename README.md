# SPARQL Endpoints Lists and Analysis

This repository contains a collection of SPARQL endpoints which have been tested using a SPARQL endpoint interrogator (part of [Visualisation Lab](https://github.com/theWebalyst/visualisation-lab)).

The sources used to obtain the initial lists of endpoints are provided along with all the inputs, some intermediate files and a set of output files in spreadsheet and text format.

## Analysis 29-April-2020

An analysis of the inputs collected on or shortly before 29-April-2020 identified 773 unique SPARQL endpoint URLs from an initial set of over 2,200.

These results have been provided for every endpoint tested as a set of spreadsheet files, and as set of text files for easier access to the endpoint URLs. Note that VisLab can also be used to copy the URLs from its table to the clipboard in JavaScript format (after updating the table).
